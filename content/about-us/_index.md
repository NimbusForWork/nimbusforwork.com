# Our Mission

Founded by Oxford tech entrepreneur Daniel Thong and industry veteran Alex Tham, Nimbus started with a passion for changing the perception of blue collared workers in Singapore.

We've come a long way from our humble beginnings of doing all the cleaning ourselves to now a large team of dedicated employees and with smart technology to help office managers better manage their workspace.

At Nimbus, we come to work every day because we want to create happy workspaces and make blue-collared services in Singapore great again. We think cleaners plumbers and handy workers are the unsung heroes that keep Singapore running smoothly and we believe that if we invest in a happier workforce and technology to empower them, we can uplift service standards as well as the economic well-being of our staff.
